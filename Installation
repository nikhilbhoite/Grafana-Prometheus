##### Data Source #####

## Time series databases ##
#1. Prometheus  Widely used in the cloud-native ecosystem for monitoring systems.
#2. Graphite    Good for visualization and basic time-series storage.
#3. InfluxDB    Open-source TSDB designed for high-performance analytics.
#4. OpenTSDB    Built on top of HBase for storing large-scale time-series data.

# What is Time series databases?
# A Time Series Database (TSDB) is a specialized type of database optimized for storing and retrieving time-stamped data. 
# This data is collected over time, typically in a consistent interval, and is often used to monitor, analyze, and visualize trends and patterns.

## Logging & document databases ##

# 1. Elasticsearch	  Commonly used in ELK/Elastic stack for log indexing and searching.
# 2. Loki (by Grafana)	Lightweight, horizontally scalable log aggregation system.

# What is a Logging Database?
# A logging database is optimized for storing and querying log data â€” records of events generated by applications, servers, or systems. 
# These logs typically include timestamps, log levels (e.g., INFO, ERROR), and messages.
